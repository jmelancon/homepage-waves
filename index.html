                    My name is Joseph Melancon. I’m 20 and currently a junior seeking a bachelor's in Computer Science at
                    University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota. I'm also pursuing minors in cybersecurity
                    and mathematics. I enjoy programming, soldering, and on occasion, video games.

                            footing to make serviceable pages. My static site generator of choice is usually Jekyll. I also
                            do web development for my university where I work in the Symfony framework for PHP.

                            experience with devices from Cisco or the like. I have taken a networking class through UND
                            and do have a basic understanding of the TCP/IPv4 suite though. I’ve also done research on
                            reporting packet flow in software defined networks.

                            with deploying an Active Directory server using Samba. I’ve got a decent grasp on the
                            structuring and management of a domain. Still got plenty of learning to do though.

                            branches, and pushing over SSH. Merging conflicting commits is still a pain point, however,
                            I grasp the basic idea. I just get filtered when <code>vimdiff</code> presents itself. Of
                            course, this is a tool I use often while at work and occasionally during group projects.

                            devices used or broken and will repair them as needed. I can repair laptops, desktops, and
                            cell phones and used to do so for my university’s IT department as a part-time job. I also do
                            a bit of soldering, though I’m admittedly not very good at it.

                            I graduated, but back in my senior year in high school, I orchestrated a migration away
                            from pen and paper data collection to full digital data collection. Doing this saved many
                            hours of work that would have been used to transcribe data from clipboards into Google
                            Sheets. This link shows the fruits of that labor. A fork of an existing data collection
